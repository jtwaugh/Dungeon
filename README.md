# Dungeon
A dungeon generator built with my implementation of the Delaunay triangulation algorithm. Requires SFML to run; I work in Visual Studio so I have no cmake to offer, but one day I may be so inspired.

Algorithm lifted from the pseudocode provided here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dlwc4/procedural_dungeon_generation_algorithm_explained/

The program looks like the below image. WASD moves the camera to inspect the dungeon.
